Did you pirate my product? 
That sucks man. I'd really appreciate it if you could throw a couple bucks out for it on the Asset Store. 
It really isn't that much money. (5$ or so.). It means I can make the next one.


Setup:
Import the Package into your project. That's it. We've done the rest of the work for you! 

Getting Values Via C#:
Add: Using Occult.UI; to the top of the script you wish to interface with the Multi-Selection Dropdown Component
List<int> selectedIndices = GetComponent<Occult.UI.MultiSelectionDropdown>().value;
The list will give you the selected indexes of the list.

Example:
If you have a Multi-Selection Dropdown with the following Configuration:
Option A
Option B
Option C

And you have selected both Option A and Option C, the values list will contain: 0, and 2

Setting the Display Values:

To set the Label displayed when the Dropdown Box contains Multiple Values:
dropdownComponent.SetMultipleDisplayString("Multiple Values Selected");

To set the Label displayed when the Dropdown Box contains Zero Values:
dropdownComponent.SetZeroDisplayString("Zero Values Selected");
